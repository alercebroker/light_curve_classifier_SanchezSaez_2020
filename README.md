Code to train and use the ALeRCE light curve classifier, presented in Sánchez-Sáez et al. 2020 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03311)

The ZTF labeled set, and the features, classifications and probabilities obtained for the unlabeled ZTF set with data until 2020/06/09 can be downloaded at Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4279623
